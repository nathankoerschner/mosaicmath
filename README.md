# MosaicMath
MosaicMath was a remote STEM tutoring company that I owned and operated from 2019 to 2022. At the end of it's life, MosaicMath had served dozens of students over hundreds of hours of remote tutoring (giving work to a handful of very talented Math, Physics, and life science tutors in the meantime!).
